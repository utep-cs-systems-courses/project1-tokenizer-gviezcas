Project 1: Tokenizer


====================
# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.

To learn about text formatting using markdown, we encourage you to examine 
 - [../README.md](../README.md)
 - the online [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

Main.c - Contains a simple interface that asks the user to enter an item to
tokenize.  Once the item is entered any extra spaces are removed, the item is
tokenized and printed to the user. The program continues to loop until the
user enters 'q' to quit the program.

Tokenizer.c - Contains all the functions used in the program. I added the
count_letters function to count all the letters and spaces in the string. I
also added the remove_spaces function that removes all the extra spaces from
the string.
